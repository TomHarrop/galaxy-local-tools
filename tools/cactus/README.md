# Cactus

The Cactus wrapper for Galaxy has been
[moved](https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc/pull/5741) to
[galaxyproject/tools-iuc](https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc/tree/main/tools/cactus)
starting from Cactus version 2.7.1.

The Snakemake workflow under `extras/` was not included in the move.
