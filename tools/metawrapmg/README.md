# MetaWrap binning

The MetaWrap binning wrapper for Galaxy has been
[moved](https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc/pull/5936) to
[galaxyproject/tools-iuc](https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc/tree/main/tools/metawrapmg).

The Snakemake workflow under `extras/` was not included in the move.
