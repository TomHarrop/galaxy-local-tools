A collection of test data files that can be re-used for tool development and testing.

**Requirements:**
- Galaxy test data max file size 500KB 
- Repo max file size 100MB (as of Sept 2020)
- Integrity: ensure that reads etc are paired and overlapping (if required)
- Docs - add an entry to the folder's `README.md` file to describe the file content

**TODO**

QuickMerge (use BAM slice):
- short read assembly (100kb section)
- long read assembly (100kb section) (same genome)
